## List of violations

### Desktop prototype

1. H3 User control and freedom\
Where: In almost each page\
What: Lack of clear navigation buttons to come back to previous pages (also in send message)\
Why: When I am in a page and I want to come back to check other pages or other information, I cannot, unless I click on the logo which brings me to the homepage but then I have to repeat all the steps to get where I want to go\
Severity: 3

2. H4 Consistency and standard\
 Where: In the popup which is shown after a successful application\
 What: Misleading behavior of the closing X button\
 Why: By closing the popup, the system comes back to the homepage that is not what the user meant to do. He just wanted to close the popup.\
 Severity: 3

3. H3 User control and freedom\
 Where: In the message writing page\
 What: Lack of the possibility to come back\
 Why: Even if this problem occurred in other pages also, here it is more serious because the only way to go out from this page is to send the message. So, if the user decides not to write anything, he cannot\
 Severity: 3

4. H3 User control and freedom\
 Where: In the applications list\
 What: Lack of the possibility to undo the application to a job proposal\
 Why: In the entire app there is not the possibility to cancel the application of a proposal. So, if a user changes his idea about a job position, he cannot undo his application\
 Severity: 3

5. H1 Visibility of system status\
 Where: In the application details page\
 What: Unpredicted behavior of the “join the interview” button\
 Why: Since the possibility to click on the “join the interview” button depends on the time slot selected for the interview, at a certain point, the button will disappear (since the time slot expires) and the user is never notified about it. Maybe it is better to show not only the start timestamp but also the end timestamp to make the user conscious about the interview situation\
 Severity: 2

6. H6 Recognition rather than recall\
 Where: In the applications list and in the application details page\
 What: Lack of and explicit and clear location indication\
 Why: There is no information about the place where the job is. It should be clearly visible instead of looking for it in the long description inside the details page\
 Severity: 2

7. H1 Visibility of system status\
 Where: In the application details page\
 What: Lack of page title\
 Why: There is no clue about where I am, I just see random information about a random application. Maybe it is better to let the user know that he is looking at the description and other details about the job he clicked on\
 Severity: 2

8. H2 Match between system and real world\
 Where: In the time slot selection page\
 What: Misleading label of the “Not interested anymore”\
 Why: This label is unclear since if the user clicks on it, he doesn’t know if he is not interested in the time slot selection or if he is not interested in the application anymore \
Severity: 2

9. H2 Match between system and real world\
 Where: In the popup for reverting the selection of a time sot\
 What: Misleading “Yes” / “No” buttons\
 Why: The buttons “Yes” / “No” are not clear and they require the user to think and read multiple time the question to understand the correct answer. Is the user interested or not interested?\
 Severity: 2

10. H7 Flexibility and efficiency of use\
 Where: In the application details page\
 What: Difficult to distinguish two different job proposals from the same company \
Why: If I have multiple proposals from the same company, they would have the same “company” title and the only way the user has to distinguish them is by reading the description. It is not very user friendly\
 Severity: 2

11. H6 Recognition rather than recall \
 Where: In the feedback list page\
 What: Lack of context, missing Application title\
 Why: The user clicked on the “see feedback” button in the application details page and the feedbacks list is shown but in the actual page there is no cue about what application these feedbacks refer to\
 Severity: 2

12.   H4 Consistency and standards\
 Where: in the whole app / to the time slot selection\
 What: No way to reach the time slot selection page rather than from the notifications popup \
Why: Since all the other actions related to the application can be done from the application page, also the time slot selection for the interview should be done from there and not only from the popup of notification. That could be a shortcut for expert users.\
 Severity: 2

13.   H2 Match between system and the real world\
 Where: In the application details page\
 What: Misleading “start the job” button meaning\
 Why: The user sees the “start the job” button and when he presses it, the video-call is opened, like the “join the interview” button does. Maybe it is better to clarify what these buttons really do. “Join the interview” is clear, but “start the job” doesn’t.\
 Severity: 1

14.   H8 Aesthetic and minimalist design\
 Where: In “Your JustWork” page\
 What: Possibility to have too many items\
 Why: Since there is not the possibility to delete some past job experiences, this page will be soon very busy\
Severity: 1

15.   H8 Aesthetic and minimalist design \
 Where: In the time slot selection page\
 What: No need of morning/afternoon distinction\
 Why: In this type of page, there is no necessity to separate in two different sections time slots for morning and for afternoon. It doesn’t add nothing to the user experience. Maybe it is also better to use a select, instead of printing lot of time slot buttons\
 Severity: 1

16.   H8 Aesthetic and minimalist design\
       Where: In the notification popup\
What: Possibility to have a messy, very long, list of notifications\
Why: There is not the possibility to remove a notification, so, after a long period of time, too many notifications will be present in this section and the user will not be able to browse them correctly. In addition, this popup is the only window where notifications are listed.\
 Severity: 1
 
 17. Heuristic 1 VideoConference Status\
Where: the problem is occurred in page 18 for the task take part of interview after it is considered and participating the work in the page 27\
What: we think the the username should show up on the videoconference both for all user\
Why: the people need to know with who is talking\
Severity: 3 Major usability problem; important to fix

18. Heuristic 3 VideoConference Control\
Where: the problem is occurred in page 18 for the task take part of interview after it is considered and participating the work in the page 27\
What: the call is full screen, if the user want to navigate other content of the web in this case he should stop the call or he should open another browser tab to browse the site he cannot browser the content and having call contemporaneously , if the call can be minimized there should be a minimize button\
Why: the user may need to browser the content of website meanwhile having a call\
Severity: 3 Major usability problem; important to fix

19. Heuristic 10 site purpose presentation\
Where: the problem is occurred in page 2 for the task 1 apply for an event of job\
What: although is a simple task if a new user registered that doesn’t know how the site work,he would like to see the application flow for a new job\
Why:give to new user a fast user guide\
Severity: 1 Cosmetic problem only; need not be fixed unless extra time is available

20. Heuristic N 2 person same slot\
Where: the problem is occurred in page 9 for the task 2 take part of interview after it is considered\
What: although with clarification during presence heuristic evaluation is clarified that the slot is inserted manually by the operator event organized ( mean each person accepted has unique time slot for him to choose) but there is still chance that manual operation can have errors so the scenario that 2 person with same slot time can happen\
Why: since as we understood the interview is one vs one so in this case how this error is managed?\
Severity: 1

21. Heuristic 6, Recognition rather than recall\
Where: the problem is occurred in page 15 for the task1, 2, 3.\
What: in this page, they use “your just work”, by clicking this button to go next windows where it would show all activities that users attend, however the button not clearly show the meaning to the next page.\
Why: it is a little hard to understand what is the purpose of this button, especially when users just start using this website.\
Severity: 2, Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority

Severity: 1

30. H7 – Flexibility and Efficiency of use\
 Where: Send a message for an available date and time.\
What: The page doesn’t allow the user to pick a date and time with a component.\

Where: My Feedbacks.\
What: The system only allows the user to download the feedback and not to see it into the software.\
Why: The user wants to just see the feedback in a simple way without downloading it. Because if it has got too much feedback, he/she has to download them and then delete them manually.\
Severity: 3

Why: The provided pages don’t include where the user will receive the answers for the sent messages.\
Severity: 2

## Prototype selected

We selected the mobile prototype because for us it is more accessible for the user and because it received more euristic violations than the desktop, so we think it is more challenging to fix.\
In a violation it was mentioned that the meaning of the state of the job application (eg in progress) is not clear. So we thought that the progress bar that we designed for the desktop could help the user to better understand the evolution of the job application.

## Plan for the hi-fi prototype

1. H3 User control and freedom
```
Where: In almost each page
What: Lack of clear navigation buttons to come back to previous pages
Why: When I am in a page and I want to come back to check other pages or other information, I cannot, unless I click on the logo which brings me to the homepage but then I have to repeat all the steps to get where I want to go
Severity: 3
```
Solution: We implemented two ways to move across the application. We inserted a navigation bar on the bottom of all pages were you can click to fast change section of the application and, when you are not in a page directly connected to the navigation bar (homepage, notification, your just work page, profile) we added a "go back" button on the top of the page. Due to the redesign of the navigation system, we decided to remove the logo of the application from the top of the page.

2. H4 Consistency and standard
```
Where: In the popup which is shown after a successful application
What: Misleading behavior of the closing X button
Why: By closing the popup, the system comes back to the homepage that is not what the user meant to do. He just wanted to close the popup.
Severity: 3
```
Solution: We decided to remove the x button and add a new button whit a label that explain to the user where he will be redirected.

3. H3 User control and freedom
```
Where: In the message writing page
 What: Lack of the possibility to come back
Why: Even if this problem occurred in other pages also, here it is more serious because the only way to go out from this page is to send the message. So, if the user decides not to write anything, he cannot
Severity: 3
```
Solution: For us this violation is a repetition, restricted to the message page, of the point 1. In addiction, it's not totally true that the user must write something because he could click on the logo of the application. With the resolution of the violation 1 we are going to fix also this one.

4. H3 User control and freedom
```
 Where: In the applications list
What: Lack of the possibility to undo the application to a job proposal
Why: In the entire app there is not the possibility to cancel the application of a proposal. So, if a user changes his idea about a job position, he cannot undo his application
Severity: 3
```
Solution: Right now the user can delete his application when he choses the time slot for the interview and sending a message to the company by the detail page of the job application. We will add a button in the detail page of the job application where the user can delete his application until it's status is not "in progress" or one of the following status.

5. H1 Visibility of system status
```
Where: In the application details page
What: Unpredicted behavior of the “join the interview” button
Why: Since the possibility to click on the “join the interview” button depends on the time slot selected for the interview, at a certain point, the button will disappear (since the time slot expires) and the user is never notified about it. Maybe it is better to show not only the start timestamp but also the end timestamp to make the user conscious about the interview situation
Severity: 2
```
Not a violation: For us this is not a violation because the button will appear for a longer time, not just in the small slot of the interview. Moreover, if the user might have some internet connection loss, the company has the user contacts, so they can comunicate with him.

6. H6 Recognition rather than recall
```
Where: In the applications list and in the application details page
What: Lack of and explicit and clear location indication
Why: There is no information about the place where the job is. It should be clearly visible instead of looking for it in the long description inside the details page
Severity: 2
```
Solution: We will add the city where the job is going to take place.

7. H1 Visibility of system status
```
Where: In the application details page
What: Lack of page title
Why: There is no cue about where I am, I just see random information about a random application. Maybe it is better to let the user know that he is looking at the description and other details about the job he clicked on
Severity: 2
```
Not a violation: For us this is not a violation because we have a lot of title (eg. Book an appointment, Tell the company when you are available, Your JustWork...).

8. H2 Match between system and real world
```
Where: In the time slot selection page
What: Misleading label of the “Not interested anymore”
Why: This label is unclear since if the user clicks on it, he doesn’t know if he is not interested in the time slot selection or if he is not interested in the application anymore
Severity: 2
```
Not a violation: for us this is not a violation because in this page the user has the button "no slots founded? send a message" and under it the button "Not interested anymore" so it's clear that if the user wants to do the job that he applied for he must chose a time slot, if he doesn't find a suitable time slots he can ask for more and if he is not interested anymore in the application he can click on this button. In any case, we will change the label to be more explanatory.

9. H2 Match between system and real world 
```
Where: In the popup for reverting the selection of a time sot\
What: Misleading “Yes” / “No” buttons\
Why: The buttons “Yes” / “No” are not clear and they require the user to think and read the question multiple times to understand the correct answer. Is the user interested or not interested?\
Severity: 2
```
Solution: we are goilg to change the title of the modal and the labels of the buttons to be more explanatory.

10. H7 Flexibility and efficiency of use
```
Where: In the application details page
What: Difficult to distinguish two different job proposals from the same company
Why: If I have multiple proposals from the same company, they would have the same “company” title and the only way the user has to distinguish them is by reading the description. It is not very user friendly
Severity: 2
```
Solution: we will add the title of the job in the application detail.

11. H6 Recognition rather than recall
```
Where: In the feedback list page
What: Lack of context, missing Application title
Why: The user clicked on the “see feedback” button in the application details page and the feedbacks list is shown but in the actual page there is no cue about what application these feedbacks refer to
Severity: 2
```
Solution: we will add the logo of the company and the title of the job.

12. H4 Consistency and standards
```
Where: in the whole app / to the time slot selection
What: No way to reach the time slot selection page rather than from the notifications popup
Why: Since all the other actions related to the application can be done from the application page, also the time slot selection for the interview should be done from there and not only from the popup of notification. That could be a shortcut for expert users.
Severity: 2
```
Not a violation: we already have this feature, probably the user wasn't able to explore that flow during the prototype evaluation.

13. H2 Match between system and the real world
```
Where: In the application details page
What: Misleading “start the job” button meaning
Why: The user sees the “start the job” button and when he presses it, the video-call is opened, like the “join the interview” button does. Maybe it is better to clarify what these buttons really do. “Join the interview” is clear, but “start the job” doesn’t.
Severity: 1
```
Solution: it's not a difficult feature to implement, we'll add a confirmation pop-up eventually.

14. H8 Aesthetic and minimalist design 
```
Where: In “Your JustWork” page
What: Possibility to have too many items
Why: Since there is not the possibility to delete some past job experiences, this page will soon be very busy.
Severity: 1
```
Not a violation: we think that filtering the past experiences is already enough to keep them ordered, also because this should be a platform to try jobs and ideally you won't have this much of past JustWork experiences.

15. H8 Aesthetic and minimalist design 
```
Where: In the time slot selection page
What: No need of morning/afternoon distinction
Why: In this type of page, there is no necessity to separate in two different sections time slots for morning and for afternoon. It doesn’t add nothing to the user experience. Maybe it is also better to use a select, instead of printing lot of time slot buttons
Severity: 1
```
Not a violation: the company provides a limited amount of slots, so having a distinction between morning and afternoon slots it's not a violation for us.

16. H8 Aesthetic and minimalist design
```
Where: In the notification popup
What: Possibility to have a messy, very long, list of notifications
Why: There is not the possibility to remove a notification, so, after a long period of time, too many notifications will be present in this section and the user will not be able to browse them correctly. In addition, this popup is the only window where notifications are listed.
Severity: 1
```
 Solution: It's an easy thing to implement, we did a separate page for notifications and also we plan to add the possibility to delete notifications.

17. H1 – Visibility of System Status
```
Where: Page with all Company’s Proposals.
What: It’s not intuitive to know what page the user is, without guessing.
Why: There isn’t the page’s title.
Severity: 2
```
Not a violation: it's the homepage, we think it's also really similiar to other similiar platforms known by young people.

18. H3 – User Control and Freedom 
```
Where: Book an Appointment page.
What: The user cannot choose the date and time at a later moment.
Why: If the user started to choose the booking date and time, but something happens so he/she needs to choose the details at a later moment, he/she cannot do it.
Severity: 2
```
Not a violation: it's actually not true, you can go back to that page by the button "book the interview" when you want.

19. H3 – User Control and Freedom
```
Where: Application List Page or Application Details Page.
What: The user can’t delete or modify an application he made.
Why: If a user made a wrong application or he/she can be present anymore, he/she can’t delete or modify it.
Severity: 3
```
Solution: We'll add the possibility to delete the application until the state is "waiting for result", after that it would not make sense to delete the application.

20. H3 – User Control and Freedom
```
Where: All pages with no “Home” Button.
What: The user cannot go back to the home page easily.
Why: The user doesn’t have a simple way to go back to the home page.
Severity: 3
```
Solution: We've added the home button in the navigation bar as suggested, replacing the logo of the application.

21. H4 – Consistency and Standards
```
Where: Pages with “Not Interested Anymore” button.
What: The button contains too long text for a simple button.
Why: Because, normally, the user doesn’t have time to read all the text, or the text could be too small to be read in a simple way (Especially on a mobile device).
Severity: 2
```
Solution: Shorten the text on the "Not Interested Anymore" button to make it concise while still conveying the intended action. Ensure that the text is clear and easily understandable at a glance. This adjustment will enhance consistency and adherence to design standards.

22. H5 – Error Prevention 
```
Where: Join Interview Page and Calling Page.
What: The system doesn’t show a method to change the starting configuration for the call.
Why: The user could want to start the call with the microphone or the camera, (or both), turned off.
Severity: 2
```
Not a violation: The prototype was designed with a focus on our three main tasks, and we intentionally did not delve into intricate details beyond that scope. 

23. H5 – Error Prevention
```
Where: Call Page.
What: The system doesn’t show a confirmation popup before exiting from a call.
Why: The user could mis-click the “Exit” button of a call.
Severity: 2
```
Not a violation: While we acknowledge the potential concern, we currently do not view it as a violation within our design framework. Moreover, it's not common in call applications that when you want to hang up the call it is asked confirmation to exit it.

24. H5 – Error Prevention
```
Where: Send messages to Company pages.
What: The “Send” button doesn’t show a popup with a message the user wants to send.
Why: If I click the “Send” button and then I forget something in the message, I can’t change it.
Severity: 3
```
Solution: Instead of displaying a popup with the entire message text, the confirmation will serve as a final review before sending, ensuring that users have the opportunity to validate their message content and make any necessary adjustments before proceeding. 

25. H5 – Error Prevention 
```
Where: Start job Page.
What: The system doesn’t show a confirmation popup before starting a job.
Why: The user could mis-click the “Start the job” button and he/she doesn’t want to start it.
Severity: 3
```
Not a violation: While we acknowledge the concern, we don't consider it a violation based on our current design approach because the button is enabled only in the time window in which the user can actually work.

26. H5 – Error Prevention
```
Where: Application Page.
What: The system doesn’t show a confirmation popup before applying for a job.
Why: The user could mis-click the “Apply” button and he/she doesn’t want to apply for it.
Severity: 3
```
Solution: Implement a confirmation popup when users click the "Apply" button, prompting them to confirm their decision. This additional step adds a layer of error prevention, reducing the likelihood of accidental job applications.

27. H6 – Recognition rather than recall
```
Where: Available Company’s Applications.
What: The page doesn’t show the scrollbar that indicates how many applications there are.
Why: The user doesn’t know how much he/she needs to scroll to see all the applications.
Severity: 3
```
Not a violation: The application will have a native scrollbar, so we didn't designed it because it is incorporated.

28. H6 – Recognition rather than recall
```
Where: User’s application list.
What: The page doesn’t show the scrollbar that indicates how many filters there are.
Why: The user doesn’t know what filters he/she can use.
Severity: 3
```
Not a violation: for us it is not a violation because the scrollbar is not a popular feature on mobile application. A slider is more familiar and in line with standards. Moreover, we added a shadow to the edge of the screen so that the user can better understand that the filters overflow the screen.

29. H7 – Flexibility and Efficiency of use
```
Where: On each page in which following the click of a button, a popup is displayed.
What: The popup button can be closed by only clicking the X. (It is not automatic).
Why: It could be more efficient to use a button that disappears automatically.
Severity: 1
```
Solution: we suppose that the "button" written in the "why" sentence it's a typo and they wanted to say that we should implement a popup that disappears automatically, so we'll do it.

30. H7 – Flexibility and Efficiency of use
```
Where: Send a message for an available date and time.
What: The page doesn’t allow the user to pick a date and time with a component.
Why: It could speed up the interaction for the expert user or could simplify the interaction for an inexperienced user.
Severity: 1
```
Not a violation: For us it is not a violation cause we think that sending a text message could give more freedom to the user to communicate with company.

31. H7 – Flexibility and Efficiency of use
```
Where: My Feedbacks.
What: The system only allows the user to download the feedback and not to see it into the software.
Why: The user wants to just see the feedback in a simple way without downloading it. Because if it has got too much feedback, he/she has to download them and then delete them manually.
Severity: 3
```
Not a violation: for us it is not a violation because we think that a feedback could include multiple digital material like reports or images, so in this way the user can see them with an appropriate reader.

32. H8 – Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
```
Where: Page where there is the “Details” button.
What: The page shows the card with a “details” button without having the card clickable.
Why: In order to open a details page, the user has to click only on the “details” button and he/she can’t click directly on the card.
Severity: 2
```
Solution: we made the card clickable, removed the button "Details", and changed it with a text "See more" to be more clear.

33. H10 – Help and Documentation
```
Where: All pages.
What: The page doesn’t allow the user to understand better what the status of an application means.
Why: The user could not understand deeply what some status means, for example what “In progress” means.
Severity: 2
```
Solution: we are going to add an help and documentation page with all the frequently asked questions.

34. H10 – Help and Documentation
```
Where: All pages.
What: The system doesn’t provide a quick way to contact the customer service.
Why: The user could have some problem during his interaction with the system and he wants to contact the customer service without going to a particular page with “Send a Message”.
Severity: 3
```
Solution: we think that this is not a valid heuristic violation because for us the customer service chat is a fetaure more suitable for applications like e-commerce where the user can buy something. In this case for us it's sufficent having a page with all the contacts, a message fild and the page with the most asked questions.

35. HN – Non Heuristic Issue
```
Where: All pages with “Send a message” functionality.
What: Missing information on where the user will receive the answer for a sent message.
Why: The provided pages don’t include where the user will receive the answers for the sent messages.
Severity: 2
```
Solution: we can implement a chat or something that allows the user to have an history of the messages.
